I am a Cloud Engineer working in the beautiful city of Bern, Switzerland.

My passion is Information Technology and Security within the Microsoft Ecosystem, especially the Cloud (M365 / Azure). I work with technologies like Exchange Online, MDO 365, Microsoft Teams, Active Directory, Entra Connect, Entra ID, and Security. In 2023/2024, I became an Automation Enthusiast and enjoy streamlining processes with various tools. Some of my automation projects are available on my GitHub Repo.
